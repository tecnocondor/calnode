# Deploying Calnode

Calnode is a **single Go binary** that embeds the admin SPA and serves the public
booking pages, with **SQLite** on a persistent volume. No separate database,
cache, or web server. The official multi-arch image (amd64 + arm64) is built by CI
from the repo `Dockerfile` (multi-stage: build the SvelteKit admin → compile Go →
small Alpine runtime) and published to GHCR:

| Tag | Points at | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/calnode/calnode:latest` | the newest tagged **release** | most deploys |
| `…:0.1.0` (exact) / `…:0.1` (tracks patches) | a pinned **release** | reproducible / version-pinned deploys (Watchtower, Dockge) |
| `…:edge` | the tip of `main` | trying unreleased changes |

Or build it yourself with `docker build -t calnode .`.

This guide covers a generic Docker deploy and a step-by-step **Railway** deploy
(the current reference host).

---

## 1. Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **prod: yes** | — | KEK input (Argon2id). **Required when `BASE_URL` is https** — the app refuses to start without it. Use a long random string: `openssl rand -hex 32`. **Losing it makes encrypted data unrecoverable** unless you set the recovery secret below. |
| `CALNODE_RECOVERY_SECRET` | recommended | — | Escrow secret so the data key can be recovered if the encryption key is rotated/lost. Store it somewhere separate. |
| `BASE_URL` | **yes (prod)** | `http://localhost:3000` | Identity host — admin UI, OAuth callbacks, invite links. **Must include the scheme** (`https://booking.example.com`). The `https://` prefix flips the app into production mode (secure cookies, encryption-key enforcement). |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | no | = `BASE_URL` | Booker-facing host for booking links/emails, if different from the identity host. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | no | `sqlite://./data/calnode.db` | Point at the persistent volume, e.g. `sqlite:///data/calnode.db`. |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | The app listens on `$PORT`. Many platforms inject their own (Railway injects `8080`) — let them. |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_USER` / `_PASS` | no¹ | — / `587` | SMTP. Can also be set later in Settings → Email (DB-stored, encrypted). |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_HOST` / `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_PORT` | no | SMTP host / port | TCP relay address, loaded at startup. Applies to environment and database SMTP settings; TLS and authentication still use the SMTP host. |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_TLS` / `_STARTTLS` | no | `false` | `STARTTLS` for 587, implicit `TLS` for 465. |
| `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` / `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | no | `bookings@localhost` / `Calnode` | The From identity. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | no | — | Google sign-in + calendar. Can also be set in Settings → Google OAuth. |
| `GOOGLE_SEND_INVITES` | no | `true` | Who emails the guest when Google Calendar is the destination. `true`: Google sends its own invite (from the host's Google account, in its language) and Calnode's email has no `.ics`. `false`: events are created with `sendUpdates=none` and Calnode's localized email carries the `.ics`, so the guest gets one email. |
| `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL` | recommended | — | Enables continuous SQLite backup (see §6). |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | no | https→true | Override cookie Secure flag; defaults from `BASE_URL` scheme. |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | no | — | Comma-separated CIDRs (a bare address = one host) whose `X-Forwarded-For` is believed when keying per-IP rate limits, e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`. Include a fronting CDN's own ranges so the walk steps over its edge and lands on the visitor. Unset ⇒ the header is ignored and the limit keys on the TCP peer, so behind a CDN every visitor shares one bucket. **Only list networks you control**: anything in the list can name any client IP it likes. Single-value vendor headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Real-IP`) are never read, from any peer. |
| `FRAME_ANCESTORS` | no | — | **Space**-separated origins allowed to embed the **admin UI** in a frame, e.g. `https://console.example.com 'self'`. Each entry must be `https://host[:port]` or `'self'` — anything else and **the app refuses to start**, because browsers drop a policy they cannot parse. Does not affect the public booking pages, which always deny framing. ⛔ **Same-site only in practice**: `calnode_session` is `SameSite=Lax`, so a cross-site parent can frame `/admin/` and still never be sent the cookie — it gets the login screen inside the frame. Use `'self'` or a host sharing `BASE_URL`'s registrable domain. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`. |

¹ Email is optional to boot, but bookings won't send confirmations until SMTP is configured (env **or** the admin UI). Precedence is **env var > DB setting > default**.

## 2. Generic Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e BASE_URL=https://booking.example.com \
  -e CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e CALNODE_RECOVERY_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/calnode.db \
  -v calnode-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/calnode/calnode:latest
```

(Or swap in your own build: `docker build -t calnode .` from the repo root, then
use `calnode` in place of the image name above.)

Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front (Caddy/nginx/Traefik). **The proxy
must forward the original `Host` header** — Calnode's CSRF check compares
`Origin`/`Referer` against `Host`, so a rewritten Host causes 403s on admin writes.

---

## 3. Railway (reference deploy)

Railway auto-detects the `Dockerfile` and builds it. Steps:

1. **Create a project + service** from the repo (or `railway up` from the repo dir).
2. **Add a volume** mounted at **`/data`** (Service → Settings → Volumes).
3. **Set variables** (Service → Variables):
   - `BASE_URL=https://<your-domain>` (with scheme)
   - `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CALNODE_RECOVERY_SECRET` (generate, keep safe)
   - `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/calnode.db`
   - (email / Google / Litestream as needed)
   - **Don't** set `PORT` — Railway injects `8080`, and the app honours it.
4. **Deploy:** `railway up` (or push-to-deploy). Migrations run automatically on boot.
5. **Custom domain** (Service → Settings → Networking → Custom Domain):
   - **Target port = the port the app is *actually* listening on.** On Railway that's
     **`8080`** (the injected `PORT`), **not** 3000. A wrong target port → 502 /
     "Application failed to respond". Check the `server listening port=…` startup log.
   - Add the CNAME (+ TXT verify) record Railway shows at your DNS provider. On
     **Cloudflare, set it to "DNS only" (grey cloud)** — proxying (orange cloud)
     blocks Railway's cert issuance and can cause redirect loops. You may re-enable
     the proxy after the cert issues, with SSL mode = Full (strict).

### Railway-specific build notes (already handled in this repo)
- **No `VOLUME` directive in the Dockerfile** — Railway's builder rejects it; storage
  comes from the managed volume.
- **pnpm under CI:** the build pins `pnpm` and lists `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`, so
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` doesn't hard-fail under `CI=true`.

---

## 4. Email (Resend recommended for production)

Gmail/Workspace SMTP **rewrites the From** to the authenticated account unless you
use a verified "Send mail as" alias — so for a branded From, use a transactional
provider. With **Resend**:

1. Verify your domain in Resend (add the SPF/DKIM/MX records it shows; **DNS-only** on Cloudflare).
2. Create an API key.
3. Settings → Email. Pick **one** of:
   - **Resend API key** (recommended): paste the key into the "Resend API key" field and
     set From `bookings@yourdomain`. Delivery goes over HTTPS. Leave the SMTP fields empty.
   - **SMTP**: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `587`, username `resend`, password = the API
     key, **STARTTLS on**, From `bookings@yourdomain`.
4. Send a test email.

### If SMTP does not work, it may not be your fault

**Many hosting platforms block outbound SMTP on their cheaper plans.** Railway disables it
below Pro; other constrained tiers do the same. They block it by *dropping* the packets
rather than refusing the connection, so from inside the container it looks exactly like a
hang, and then exactly like a wrong password. No SMTP setting can work around it: ports 25,
465, 587 and 2525 all behave identically, and it is not specific to Resend.

The fix is the **Resend API key** field above, which sends over HTTPS on port 443. That is
never blocked, and it is what Resend itself recommends regardless of platform.

Which path is actually in use is shown as a badge at the top of Settings → Email, so
"SMTP fields are filled in" is never mistaken for "mail is going out over SMTP". Setting an
API key takes precedence over the SMTP fields; clearing it ("Remove key") switches back.

> Email settings are stored **per instance** in that instance's DB — staging/prod/local each need their own.

---

## 5. Google OAuth (sign-in + calendar)

In Google Cloud Console → Credentials → your OAuth client, add **Authorized
redirect URIs** (derived from `BASE_URL`):

```
https://<your-domain>/v1/auth/callback
https://<your-domain>/v1/calendar/callback
```

Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (env or Settings → Google OAuth — the
page shows the exact redirect URIs for the running instance). Calendar is a
sensitive scope, so submit the app for verification before wide public use
(unverified = warning screen + 100-user cap).

---

## 6. Backups (Litestream)

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) streams the SQLite DB continuously to
**S3-compatible** object storage (≈1-second RPO) and **restores it automatically on
boot** if the volume comes up empty (lost/replaced). It's built into the image and
supervises the app (`entrypoint.sh` runs `litestream replicate -exec /calnode`).

**Backups are OFF until you set the env vars below** — until then the container
just runs the app directly. A single volume with no replica is the biggest
data-loss risk, so enable this before real bookings exist.

### Universal config (one set of vars, any provider)

Because R2, B2, MinIO, Spaces, Wasabi, and AWS all speak the S3 API, the same five
variables cover every provider — only the endpoint/region change:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL` | `s3://<bucket>/calnode` — the bucket + path. Setting this turns backups ON. (For native Google Cloud Storage use `gcs://` — see below.) |
| `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT` | Provider S3 endpoint. **Leave unset for AWS.** |
| `LITESTREAM_REGION` | Bucket region (`auto` for R2). |
| `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Access key (use a bucket-scoped key, not a root credential). |
| `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Secret key. |

Per-provider values (everything else is identical):

| Provider | `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT` | `LITESTREAM_REGION` |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare R2** | `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` | `auto` |
| **Backblaze B2** | `https://s3.<region>.backblazeb2.com` | `<region>` (e.g. `us-west-004`) |
| **AWS S3** | *(unset)* | e.g. `us-east-1` |
| **MinIO / self-host** | `https://minio.example.com` | `us-east-1` |

**Two easy mistakes:**
1. `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT` is the **account** endpoint — do **not** append the bucket
   name. Litestream takes the bucket from `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL`; a bucket in both
   places fails. (R2 shows the S3 API URL *with* the bucket — drop the last path segment.)
2. For R2, `LITESTREAM_REGION` is always **`auto`**, not the bucket's physical
   location (WNAM/ENAM/etc.). A real region string makes R2 reject the signature.

If the endpoint/region are empty or wrong, Litestream silently falls back to **AWS**
and you'll see `InvalidAccessKeyId` (403) in the logs (your R2 key sent to Amazon).

### Google Cloud Storage (native, not via the S3 API)

The bundled Litestream also speaks **GCS natively**, which is the simpler option on GCP:
credentials come from the instance metadata server, so there is no access key to create,
store or rotate. One variable is enough:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL` | `gcs://<bucket>/calnode` |

- ⛔ **The scheme is `gcs://`, not `gs://`.** `gs://` is the scheme every other Google tool
  uses, and Litestream rejects it with `unknown replica type in config: ""` and exit 1 —
  before any network call, so it looks nothing like a credentials or bucket problem.
- **Leave `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT`, `LITESTREAM_REGION`, `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
  `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` unset.** The bundled `/etc/litestream.yml` needs no edit:
  its `endpoint:` and `region:` lines expand to empty strings, and a `gcs` replica ignores
  both.
- The service account attached to the instance needs read **and** write on the bucket
  (read is what restore uses). Everything else on this page — the restore drill, the
  private-bucket warning, the PII note — applies unchanged.

⚠️ **The trade: meeting recordings need the two S3 credential variables, so a native GCS
replica leaves recording storage unavailable.** `recordingStorage()`
(`internal/handler/livekit_recording.go`) reuses the backup bucket for recordings over the
S3 API and requires `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; without
both it reports not-configured. It degrades cleanly rather than failing at record time —
**Settings → Storage** shows `recordings_storage_ready: false` and the room's Record button
stays hidden.

The provider table above has no GCS row, so "use the S3-compatible route" is not by itself
an answer on GCP. The two real options:

- **Put the replica on an S3-API bucket** (R2, B2, AWS, MinIO — the providers above) and
  set all five variables. This is the route this page documents end to end.
- **Or reach the same GCS bucket through Google's S3 interoperability API**: an HMAC key
  pair as `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
  `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT=https://storage.googleapis.com`, and an `s3://` replica URL. That is
  the ordinary S3-compatible route with GCS as the provider, not the native `gcs://` one.
  ⚠️ We have not exercised recording this way — we run native `gcs://` with recordings off —
  so it is stated as the shape of the answer, not as a configuration we have verified.

`docs/VIDEO.md` §2 lists exactly what recording needs from either route.

### Enabling it
1. Create a **private** bucket and a **bucket-scoped** access key (read + write — read is needed for restore).
   *(Native GCS: create the bucket and grant the instance's service account read + write; there is no key.)*
2. Set the five variables on the service (Railway → Variables, or your platform's
   equivalent) — or, for native GCS, just `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL`.
3. Redeploy. On boot Litestream initialises and the first snapshot uploads within ~10s.
4. **Verify the round-trip** before relying on it (below).

> The backup contains booking PII (names, emails, intake answers) in plaintext —
> keep the bucket **private**. Calnode's encrypted secrets (SMTP/OAuth) stay sealed
> by the envelope-encryption key even inside the backup.

### Verifying / restoring
Recovery is automatic: if the volume comes up empty, `entrypoint.sh` restores the
latest replica from object storage before starting the app. To **prove the
round-trip without touching the live DB**, restore to a scratch path (never
`/data/calnode.db`) and confirm it's a valid SQLite file.

**Non-destructive drill, in the container (zero setup — litestream + creds + config are already there):**
```bash
railway ssh --service calnode sh -lc '
  rm -f /tmp/check.db
  litestream restore -config /etc/litestream.yml -o /tmp/check.db /data/calnode.db
  ls -l /tmp/check.db          # non-zero, ~ the live DB size
  head -c 16 /tmp/check.db; echo   # "SQLite format 3" = valid, replayed from the replica
  rm -f /tmp/check.db
'
```
It writes only to `/tmp` (ephemeral) and reads from the replica, so the running
app and the `/data` volume are untouched. (The runtime image has no `sqlite3` CLI,
hence the header check; for a full `PRAGMA integrity_check`, restore locally below.)

**Locally (full integrity check):** install the `litestream` binary, export the five
`LITESTREAM_*` vars, then:
```bash
litestream restore -config litestream.yml -o ./check.db /data/calnode.db
sqlite3 ./check.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"   # expect: ok
```

Run a drill after first enabling backups, and periodically thereafter — an
unverified backup isn't a backup.

## 7. Built-in video & recording (LiveKit)

Optional — only if you want Calnode-hosted in-browser meetings as a booking location.
Full setup guide, including recording consent, the AI notetaker, and host controls:
[docs/VIDEO.md](docs/VIDEO.md).

- **Credentials live in the app, not env vars.** Create a project at
  [cloud.livekit.io](https://cloud.livekit.io) (or self-host LiveKit), then enter the
  **Server URL** (`wss://…`), **API Key**, and **API Secret** in **Settings → Video**.
  "Calnode Video (LiveKit)" then becomes selectable as an event-type location.
- **Recording reuses your Litestream bucket.** If `LITESTREAM_*` (§6) is configured,
  meeting recordings are written to that same bucket under a `recordings/` prefix — no
  extra storage to set up. Turn recording on in **Settings → Video / Storage**; downloads
  appear on the **Recordings** page (presigned, short-lived URLs).
- **Register the webhook (recommended).** In **Settings → Video**, copy the webhook URL
  (`https://<your-domain>/v1/livekit/webhook`) into **LiveKit Cloud → Project → Settings →
  Webhooks**, and attach the **same API key** you entered above (it signs the events).
  Recordings still finalize without it — the webhook just adds accurate duration and a
  clean "room closed" backstop. A healthy hit shows `POST /v1/livekit/webhook → 200`; a
  `403` means the webhook's API key doesn't match the one in Settings → Video.

---

## 8. Zoom meeting links

Optional. With a Zoom app configured in **Settings → Zoom**, each host connects their own
Zoom account (Calendar page) and a Zoom-located booking gets a meeting minted under the
assigned host's account. The settings page shows the exact **Redirect URL** to register
(`https://<your-domain>/v1/zoom/callback`).

**Who can connect depends on how the Zoom app is distributed, and that is Zoom's rule,
not Calnode's.** A Zoom **General app** that is not published to the Zoom App Marketplace
can only be authorized by users inside the Zoom account that created it. A member who signs
in with their own, separate Zoom account is refused by Zoom before the request ever reaches
Calnode (they land on a Marketplace "Something went wrong" page). Zoom offers three ways
around that, none of them a Calnode setting:

- **Bring the hosts into your Zoom account.** Members of the app's own Zoom account can
  connect an unpublished app. Joining puts their Zoom user under your account's
  administration and licensing, so this suits a team that already shares one Zoom
  account, not independent people.
- **Beta sharing.** On request, Zoom's review team can approve an authorization URL for
  users outside your account: up to 100 of them for a user-level app, valid for 4 weeks
  with two further 4-week extensions. It is a test channel, not a permanent one.
- **Publish the app** to the Zoom App Marketplace, which requires passing Zoom's app
  review.

Details: Zoom's [App distribution](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/distribute/) and
[Sharing private and beta apps](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/distribute/sharing-private-and-beta-apps/).

If none of those fits, a Zoom-located event type still works without any Zoom app: set a
**Zoom link** on the event type and every booking carries that link (one link per event
type, so it suits a personal meeting room rather than a rotation of hosts). The built-in
video rooms (§7) need no per-host account at all.

## 9. First run

Open `https://<your-domain>/` → it redirects to `/admin/`. On a fresh database
you'll be guided through **first-run setup** (create the owner account). Then:
Settings → Email, → Google OAuth, → Branding (logo, business name), and create your
first event type + availability.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| App won't start (prod) | Missing `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with an https `BASE_URL`. |
| Custom domain 502 / "Application failed to respond" | Custom-domain **target port ≠ the listening port** (use 8080 on Railway). |
| `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` on a new domain | Cert not issued yet — wait; ensure the DNS record is **DNS-only**, not proxied. |
| 403 on admin actions behind a proxy | Proxy not forwarding the original `Host` header (CSRF same-origin check). |
| OAuth `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Registered URI doesn't match `BASE_URL` + `/v1/...callback` exactly. |
| Connecting Zoom works for you but a member lands on Zoom's "Something went wrong" page | The Zoom app is unpublished and the member's Zoom account is not in the account that owns it (§8). |
| Email `550 domain not verified` | From address domain isn't verified with your email provider. |
| Logo broken in email when testing locally | Gmail's image proxy can't reach `localhost` — only loads from a public URL. |
| Litestream `InvalidAccessKeyId` / 403, log shows `endpoint=""` | `LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT` unset (or the running build predates the endpoint/region config) → Litestream defaults to AWS. Set the **account** endpoint (no bucket) + `region=auto` for R2, and redeploy so the config is live. |

### SMTP through a TCP relay

Set `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_HOST` and `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_PORT` to dial a TCP relay instead of the configured SMTP address. Each unset value falls back to the SMTP host or port. The original SMTP host remains the TLS server name and authentication identity; certificate verification stays enabled. These overrides are loaded at startup and apply to both environment and database SMTP settings, including settings reloads and test emails. Restart after changing the relay environment variables. An active relay is logged when the SMTP mailer is configured. The relay must forward the SMTP connection without terminating TLS.
